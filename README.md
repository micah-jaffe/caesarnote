# Caesarnote

[Caesarnote](https://caesarnote.herokuapp.com/) is a cryptographic cloud-based note-taking app inspired (heavily) by Evernote. Caesarnote implements many of the core features of Evernote, including:
* Note creation, editing, and deletion with full-featured rich-text editing, autosave, and full-screen mode
* Notebooks and tags for note organization
* Shortcuts for faster navigation

Unlike Evernote, which has been subject to [data leaks](https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/04/tech/web/evernote-hacked/index.html) in the past, Caesarnote ships with [state-of-the-art note encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) to make your data cryptographically impenetrable.

Caesarnote's tech stack consists of React and Redux on the front end and Ruby on Rails and PostgresQL on the backend. The project incorporates the React-Quill library for rich-text editing. Caesarnote was designed and built in 10 days.
